# Satellite_Imagery_Segmentation

Do you ever wanted to perform automated segmentation on satellite imagery. With this Google Colab project I want to give you a hands on and understanding of segmentation tasks on satellite imagery. This notebook is based on Prodramp workshops: Deep learning Workshop for Satellite Imagery. But it's not only the bare code. I tried to explain methods models etc. inside the code so You would better understand what's going on why I chosed this metric how the dimension looks like. Next i want to change the infrastructure of U-NET according to papers like "Detection of Surface Crevasses over Antarctic Ice Shelves Using SAR Imagery and Deep Learning Method" of scientist from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, articles: "Satellite Image Segmentation: a Workflow with U-Net" and other resources like github repository of Alex-Mathai-98: "Satellite-Image-Segmentation-Using-U-NET". Hope you find it helpfull!
